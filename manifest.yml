    description: |
      The original Links spreadsheet with the following columns appended:

      * `UnwoundLink` -- The unwound form of the input link
      * `Outcome` -- The HTTP response code family of the last hop, which is
        a reasonable first indicator of unwinding success
      * `IsCanonical` -- A boolean to indicate whether the link is
        [canonical](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10347851?hl=en),
        which is a good second indicator of unwinding success
      * `UnwoundHostname`-- The hostname portion of the unwound link
      * `UnwoundSite` -- The [public suffix](https://publicsuffix.org/), or 
        roughly the site portion, of the hostname
